<p>When developing websites and web applications, you come to build certain functionality over and over again. To make building an application faster, it would be nice to have a library of existing functions to use instead of reinventing the wheel for the zillionth time. That was the reason I'm currently collecting all kinds of useful <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> functions into modules, which can be used in web applications and will be put here to be downloaded for Free [<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>'ed].</p>

<p>Part of <a href="page/html/qik/">the Qik framework</a> consists of these modules. Also the <a href="page/html/blog/">simplog weblog software</a> makes use of it. Because of that, the modules are currently in active development. A snapshot will become available when the codebase stabilizes again.</p>
