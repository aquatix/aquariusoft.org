<h2>HTML modules package</h2>

<p>When developing websites and web applications, you come to build certain functionality over and over again. To make building an application faster, it would be nice to have a library of existing functions to use instead of reinventing the wheel for the zillionth time. That was the reason I'm currently collecting all kinds of useful <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> functions into modules, which can be used in web applications and will be put here to be downloaded for Free [GPL'ed].</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Will be available at the end of January</p>
