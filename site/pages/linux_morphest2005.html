<h2>News</h2>
<p>20051120: I just sent out a HOWTO email, which you can <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/index.php?rantid=340">also read online</a> [except for my full address]</p>

<p>20051125: Alex[treme] and Jure [Gandalfar] have arrived, after Jure traveled for about 12 hours from his place in Slovenia to our base here...</p>

<p>20051126: Everybody, save for Annelies [ChickTux] has arrived. Annelies has <a href="http://www.anneliesje.thehosting.nl/blog/pictures/auto/">had an accident</a> with her moms car after having her driving license for just 24 hours. Gotta hate slippery roads on top of dykes... But check <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/morphest05/pool/">the Morphest 2005 pictures</a> too! The only girl in the picture is Michiel's [aquatix'] girlfriend Ineke.</p>

<p>2005-11-27 15:31: everyone is getting awake, eating some breakfast, showering, lounging at #morphix or just staring blankly at their web browser. We took the first train back [why does the first train going north is at 6:52AM on Sunday..?] So at 8AM we where all laying in a coma. BTW, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17648144@N00/67128700/in/pool-morphest05/">check the annotated group picture</a> [hoover over the faces for the names]</p>


<h2>Where and how?</h2>
<p>It boils down to the fact that I'll host the fun, as Alextreme's place is a bit too cramped to house the number of people. I live half an hour [with public transport] north of Amsterdam [in Heemskerk FYI].</p>

<h3>Sleeping</h3>
<p>I will have sleeping room for about 7 people -- a number we seem to have reached now -- maybe even more people will fit if everybody lines up neatly and don't mind sharing the same floor :) [However, I want to take 7 as a max for the moment]. If possible, bring your own sleeping bag and other stuff. If even more people want to attend, we can always try to find a [cheap] hotel in the neighbourhood.</p>

<h3>Stuff to bring</h3>
<p>Of course, bring along digicams, laptops [I've got wifi and an adsl connection] and other gadgets/toys and stuff. Sleeping gear like a sleeping bag, your favorite rug or something to sleep on may be handy too.</p>
<p>If you need something that is best bought here, let me know.</p>

<p>Update @ 2005-11-20: At this moment it looks like we have 5 regular mattresses, and one slim one. Furthermore, we have two [smallish] couches and a stretcher. About 7 sleeping bags and some blankets are accounted for too. Olivier, Marc, maybe can you bring your own mattress or something by car?</p>

<p>Update @ 2005-11-26: I just hope everybody fits :P First night will be spent at clubs and pubs in Amsterdam anyhow :)</p>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>As stated, I live in Heemskerk, a small city north of Amsterdam. I will mail you my exact address on request.</p>

<p>I've investigated what the easiest/cheapest way of getting here is, and figured the train will suite us fine. From station Uitgeest [city very near Heemskerk], I'll drive to our apartment then. Cabs are quite expensive [EUR22.50 pp], and parking costs for my car are quite high too, apart from the hassle. A train ticket is about EUR3.20 when using the reduction I get when showing my public transports card, and I know my way.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>If you want to come over too [or share in the fun of the moment], please say so in #morphix at irc.freenode.net or mail me [morphest at aquariusoft dot org] or alextreme.</p>


<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Of course we will enjoy some beer and other drinks, but as there's a decent network and internet connection available, some Morphix hacking may take place too.</p>
<p>Besides that, I think it'd be cool to do some sightseeing in Amsterdam. If you have something in mind, please let me know.</p>
