My personal configuration for everything CLI (the non-sensitive parts, that is). Mainly as a source for other people to draw inspiration from (like I do from other people's repo's), and for reference purposes.

For example, check [my vimrc](https://github.com/aquatix/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc) or [ssh config.d snippet](https://github.com/aquatix/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc#L169-L182).

Also, bash, fish shell, screen, tmux configurations (and more), and some scripts in `bin` that have been rather helpful for myself.


## What? No ssh config or AWS keys? Lame!

Yeah. Sorry. I keep the more sensitive stuff hidden away in a completely separate repository.
