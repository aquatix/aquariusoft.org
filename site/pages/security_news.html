<h2>Under construction</h2>
<p>This section is dedicated to computer security. You'll find checklists and other general and more specific information about all kinds of security related issues here. I will speak about Windows security, the various virusses of that platform and the bugs. Linux and unix security will be subject of articles too.</p>
