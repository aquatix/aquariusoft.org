paragoo is a static site generator, written in Python. It takes a simple [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file with the structure of the site, the source Markdown/HTML content files and the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) based templates and builds a directory structure with the final website.

The name is derived from παράγω, which is Greek for 'generate', 'produce'.
