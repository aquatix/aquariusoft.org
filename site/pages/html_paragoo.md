paragoo is a static site generator, written in Python. It takes a simple [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file with the structure of the site, the source Markdown/HTML content files and the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) based templates and builds a directory structure with the final website.

The name is derived from παράγω, which is Greek for 'generate', 'produce'.

## paragoo Material design theme

To be able to kick-off a paragoo-based web site really quickly, some basic themes were developed. The [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) theme for [paragoo](https://github.com/aquatix/paragoo) site generator, is a set of themes using a [Material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) look with pre-made responsive views. They are all the same grid, but vary in colours.
