<h2>overload <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> reader</h2>

<p>I'm currently developing a webbased, Open Source [GPLed] news feed reader, which you can use <a href="/overload/">on this server</a>, or download and install on your own webserver, needing only <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> and a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.</p>

<p>overload is based on <a href="http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/">the magpierss parser</a> [currently version 0.71.1] and is written in pure <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> using only this parser and a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.</p>

<p>Relatively stable snapshots will be used to power <a href="/overload/">the reader on this server</a> [log in for a demonstration with the user/password combo demo/demo] and the source will become available when it's usable for third parties, but expect a tarball soon.</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="https://aquariusoft.org/overload/">overload through secured http [https, SSL]</a>, which is secured by a self-signed security certificate, which you'll get a warning about. This is OK in this case, as you're not using it to identify us, but for securing your information over the internet. Be wary of those warnings in other cases, though!</p>
