<!--<h2>overload <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> reader</h2>-->

<p>I'm currently developing a webbased, Open Source [<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>'ed] news feed reader, which you can use <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">on it's own address</a>, or download and install on your own webserver, needing only <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> and a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.</p>

<p>overload is based on <a href="http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/">the magpierss parser</a> [currently version 0.71.1 with some small patches] and is written in pure <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> using only the magpierss parser and a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database.</p>

<!--
<p>Relatively stable snapshots will be used to power <a href="/overload/">the reader on this server</a> [log in for a demonstration with the user/password combo demo/demo] and the source will become available when it's usable for third parties, but expect a tarball soon.</p>
-->

<p>Currently, the version online is the "development" version. You may experience some minor breakage now and then, but nothing serious as it's intended to be used. If larger changes are made, an other address will be used to ensure the usability of the reader.</p>

<p>If you use <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">the version aquariusoft.org is running</a>, your browser will notify you of the use of a self-signed security certificate. As we are not trying to prove who we are, but rather just want you to use a secure channel, you can allow your browser to install it in it's list. Be wary of those warnings in other cases, though!</p>
