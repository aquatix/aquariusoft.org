<p>No standalone bookmarking webapplication will be developed. However, <a href="page/html/overload/">the new overload will contain bookmarking functionality</a>. If you are looking for a standalone web based bookmark utility that integrates into your browser, check the <a href="http://www.sitebar.org/">Sitebar project</a>.</p>
