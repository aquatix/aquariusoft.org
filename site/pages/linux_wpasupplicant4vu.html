<p>As I study <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">Computer Science on the Vrije Universiteit</a> in Amsterdam, I wanted to use my <a href="http://www.debian.org/">GNU/Linux</a> laptop with their wireless network. As they are using some neat encryption schemes, involving rotating wep keys, eap-ttls, pap and such, for which you need the Aegis client on windows [or the Intel Pro/wireless program as I use with my <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">ipw2200 chip</a> on my Centrino based laptop]. <a href="page/linux/xsupplicant4vu/">I had to configure xsupplicant</a> accordingly, but now <a href="">wpasupplicant</a> suits my needs better. You can find my configuration for this program on this page. See for more information <a href="page/linux/xsupplicant4vu/">the page with information for setting up xsupplicant</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure your /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf looks like this:</p>
<pre>
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0

eapol_version=1
ap_scan=1
fast_reauth=1

network={
	ssid="VU-Campusnet"
	mode=0
	scan_ssid=1
	key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
	eap=TTLS
	anonymous_identity="anonymous@vu.nl"
	phase2="auth=PAP"
	identity="vunetID@vu.nl"
	password="password"
	ca_cert="/etc/1x_wpasupplicant/CA-VU.cer"
}
</pre>

<p>/etc/default/wpasupplicant may have to be modified too [set ENABLED=1 for example, and you may have to change your DRIVER; wext works fine for my Centrino based laptop with an IPW2200 chip.</p>
