<p>How to import (self-signed) certificates into the certificate store of your phone if the application doesn't do this for you.</p>

<p>This can be of use if the mail client silently refuses your self-signed certificate (it refuses to continue in the setup wizard where you entered your IMAP credentials with use of SSL for example).</p>

<p>This howto assumes a <em>rooted phone</em> and talks specifically about certificates for mail. These can be substituted for other applications of course. You also need the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/">Android developer toolkit</a>, or more specifically the adb tool. This tutorial assumes it's in your PATH, but you can provide a full path (like /usr/local/bin/android/android-sdk-linux/tools/adb). Also, it works best when performed as <em>root</em> on your pc.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Get the latest bcprov-jdk16-NNN.jar from <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html">http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html</a></li>
	<li>Get /etc/ssl/certs/dovecot.der from your server (exact location may vary); this is the certificate used by the Dovecot IMAPs server</li>
	<li>Similarly, get /etc/exim4/exim.crt from your server; this is for smtp (sending of email)</li>
</ul>

<pre>
# install the jar, on my debian/ubuntu box that's this:
sudo mv bcprov-jdk16-145.jar /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.14/jre/lib/ext/

# add the certificate as trusted cert
keytool -importcert -keystore cacerts.bks -storetype BKS -provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -storepass changeit -trustcacerts -alias YOURSERVER_dovecot -file dovecot.der

# test whether it worked
keytool -keystore cacerts.bks -storetype BKS -provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -storepass changeit -v -list| grep -i yourserver

# Repeat this for exim.crt:
keytool -importcert -keystore cacerts.bks -storetype BKS -provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -storepass changeit -trustcacerts -alias YOURSERVER_exim -file exim.crt

# Now upload to the phone. First mount its /system read/write:
adb shell mount -o remount,rw /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system

# Upload the certificates
adb push cacerts.bks /system/etc/security/

# Remount /system read-only
adb shell mount -o remount,ro /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system
</pre>

<p>Kill Mail on your device or reboot. Setup of your email account should work now.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1016#c34">this comment</a>, but with fixes.</p>
