<p>The software <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/~mbscholt/">the dammIT weblog</a> is using, will be available as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>'ed source here. It's a simple, easy to set up weblog, which can be skinned nicely with the use of style sheets.</p>

<p>Officially called 'simplog' as of 2006-04-29, this small suite provides a simple weblog written in plain PHP and uses a MySQL back-end. The source needs some minor updates and a default non-dammIT theme needs to be created, after which it will be put online here. Maybe it needs renaming to dammlog or dammitlog beforehand, as simplog already seems to exist.</p>
