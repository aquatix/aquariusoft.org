<h2>Qik site framework</h2>

<p>Framework to quickly set up a website from scratch. Use flat files or a database, your choice.</p>

<p>The current version, which will be available online in a few days, uses flat files to quickly build a full-fletched website, like the <a href="/">aquariusoft.org</a> website you're currently visiting, of the <a href="http://www.mapleleaves.nl/">website of the Dutch basketball club Mapleleaves</a>.</p>

<p>More to come</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Will be available at the end of January</p>
