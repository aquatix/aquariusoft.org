<p>On this page I will release the source of my own <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> for public consumption. It's simple, clean and modular and used for this aquariusoft.org website.</p>

<p>UPDATE: as the code is quite old, and there's still no editing backend for aqute, I don't think I'll release it publicly. Also, this aquariusoft.org website now runs <a href="page/html/qik/">on the Qik framework</a>, which uses flat files [database support may come in the future], and is a lot better to maintain.</p>
