<p>Like all of you, we enjoy great software. Because we encounter lots of software on our quest to the Perfect Desktop(tm) and the Perfect Webbrowsing Experience(tm), we would like to share some gems with you.</p>


<h2>Mozilla Firefox plugins</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> and it's great [and Outlook Express virus free] <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> can be found on the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla website</a>.</p>

<h3>AdBlock extension</h3>

<p>Adblock is a content filtering plug-in for the Mozilla and Firebird browsers. It is both <i>more robust</i> and <i>more precise</i> than the built-in image blocker.</p>
<p>Adblock allows the user to specify filters, which remove unwanted content based on the source-address. If this sounds complicated, don't worry: it's not.</p>
<p>Just add a few filters. Every time a webpage loads, Adblock will intercept and disable the elements matching your filters. See?- nothing to it.</p>

<h3>All-in-One Gestures</h3>
<p>If the ease of navigation with mouse gestures doesn't convince your sceptical friends, maybe nothing will. Totally addictable.</p>
