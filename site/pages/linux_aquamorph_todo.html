<h2>Some mild warnings</h2>

<p>Reactions indicate that aquamorph is coming along quite well, but there's always a lot to be done. Not only with aquamorph itself, but also with the <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a> project, it's base modules, the various tools and the autobuild subproject. Speaking about the Morphix base; aquamorph v0.2 uses Morphix base 0.4-1e, which still uses kernel 2.4.x [testing bases with 2.6.12 and 2.6.14 have been generated now], and has some problems of it's own. Rebooting from the prompt seems to be non-functional for instance.</p>
<p>Another note of warning is for using the Morphix installer and grub. It all should function well, but I didn't test aquamorph with an install. If you succeed or encounter problems, please let me know with an e-mail at <i>aquamorph at aquariusoft dot org</i>, or in <a href="http://www.morphix.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1501&amp;forum=4&amp;jump=1">this thread at the Morphix site</a>. UPDATE: or come on over to the <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?id=4">aquamorph forum</a>.</p>


<h2>aquamorph todo</h2>

<ul>
	<li>make minimod for personal changes to the workspace in addition to a bare autobuilded mainmod [main module is modified to include modifications to the desktop]</li>
	<li>keeping in mind to stay light [no OpenOffice.org for that reason]</li>
	<li>use new [pre-]0.5 base from <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a> [will use 0.5-pre5 or 0.5-pre6 if the latter is usable]</li>
	<li>lots :)</li>
	<li>soon more</li>

</ul>
