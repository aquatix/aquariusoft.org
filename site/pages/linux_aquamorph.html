<h2>Introducing</h2>
<!--
<p>Originally based on <a href="http://morphix.org">Morphix' Lightgui</a> and upgraded to the newest base availabe [<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/morphix/MorphixBase-0.4-0c.iso?download">base 0.4-0e</a> for version 0.2], aquamorph is a rather complete livecd. It features <a href="http://www.xfce.org">xfce4</a> and many tools I use in my daily life. I included my own Morphix cq. aquamorph background, and all plugins for the xfce4 panel I found in the Debian/sid and os-works.com repositories, plus the cpugraph one I compiled myself [please let me know if you're missing one from <a href="http://xfce-goodies.berlios.de">xfce-goodies.berlios.de</a>]. It's up-to-date [apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade is soooo wonderfull] and includes more programs to be even more usefull ;). Well, it's more that I've made it rather slick and complete, so I could install it right on my own computers when I want to clean up / install :) or just want a working <a href="http://www.debian.org/">GNU/Linux</a> environment on a non-*nix pc. Besides that, I came to use it quite frequently for reparing broken installs of various OS'es with a livecd session too.</p>
<p>aquamorph aims to be a livecd with all programs an average computer user needs [like browser, email and <acronym title="Instant Messageing">IM</acronym> software, powerful enough office programs, multimedia software etc], and some development tools for the more powerful user, but staying light, easy to comprehend and attractive to the eye.</p>
<p>Take a look at the current <a href="/projects/aquamorph/README">README</a>, including changelog, todo list and stuff.</p>

<p><em>aquamorph version 0.4 has been released!</em> Originally based on <a href="http://morphix.org/">Morphix' Lightgui</a>, aquamorph is a complete, up-to-date environment, in which the user can comfortably browse, program and generally just do his work, while not having to worry about configuring and installing things. It features programs like Mozilla's Firefox browser and Thunderbird e-mail client, X-Chat for IRC chatting, Gaim <em>version 2</em> for Instant Messaging, Abiword and Gnumeric for doing office work, Wireshark [formerly Ethereal] for doing forensic research etc. It also packages some nice fontS AND audio/video codecs. The Java 1.5 environment has been left out for space reasons, besides it still being non-Free.</p>

<p>Releases have been slow, but the aquamorph project has be set up to make the process of creating a new mainmodule and therefore a new cd image [.iso] a lot easier, and even scriptable [read: automated]. I'm able to create a completely up-to-date image in just a few commands now, so it will be up to <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' hosting to set the pace in which I can upload new versions. I think I'll release once a month, but of course that depends on my free time and <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' hosting.</p>

<p>Of course it's nice to hear from users, whether they are happy, or have some things to add. <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?id=4">Please be welcome to the aquamorph forum</a>.</p>


<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>Today, September the 5th 2006 [<a href="http://www.livecd.org/">Morphix Commit Day 2006</a>] saw the light of <a href="files/linux/aquamorph_0.4.iso">aquamorph v0.4 final</a>!</p>
<p><del>Download the 0.4 Release Candidate! [v0.4rc1, released 2006-09-03] from this not too fast server</del> [<em>update</em>: the final is there, yay!]. This build doesn't have Sun's Java, as it's still non-Free and takes in a lot of space. If there's demand for it, I'll put it in anyway. There *are* fonts and audio/video codecs on board, so go ahead and enjoy. I'll test it on some real machines [thus far, only on emulators], and maybe write a manual, after which the final will appear here, and will be available for download from faster sites.</p>
<p>Download the really old version [v0.2, released 2004-07-28] from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71814">Morphix' SourceForge.net repository</a>, but you may better wait a few more days for v0.4 [trying to have a new version at Friday the 23rd of June].</p>
