<h2>Introducing</h2>
<p><em>aquamorph version 0.4 has been released!</em> Originally based on <a href="http://morphix.org/">Morphix' Lightgui</a>, aquamorph is a complete, up-to-date environment, in which the user can comfortably browse, program and generally just do his work, while not having to worry about configuring and installing things. It features programs like Mozilla's Firefox browser and Thunderbird e-mail client, X-Chat for IRC chatting, Gaim <em>version 2</em> for Instant Messaging, Abiword and Gnumeric for doing office work, Wireshark [formerly Ethereal] for doing forensic research, Graveman for burning CDs/DVDs etc. It also packages some nice fonts and audio/video codecs. The Java 1.5 environment has been left out for space reasons, besides it still being non-Free.</p>

<p>So, what's the aim of aquamorph? First of all, it's intended to be a polished, intuitive GNU/Linux environment. This way you can impress people with the world outside microsoft's and apple's. The applications included are intended for daily tasks, forensics and fixing computers. A plus is that, when installed to hard disk, the user instantly has a usable environment.</p>

<p>Releases have been slow, but the aquamorph project has be set up to make the process of creating a new mainmodule and therefore a new cd image [.iso] a lot easier, and even scriptable [read: automated]. I'm able to create a completely up-to-date image in just a few commands now, so it will be up to <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' hosting to set the pace in which I can upload new versions. I think I'll release once a month, but of course that depends on my free time and <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' hosting.</p>

<p><em>2007-09-17:</em> as you may have noticed, releases are still slow. Real life is taking its toll, and not having enough hard disk space also complicates matters. Still, the project is not dead, and when new hardware comes in, automated builds will be kicked off.</p>

<p><em>2010-01-29</em> nowadays there are a lot of livecds around. Still, having a clean environment to debug a pc with -- or use as linux workstation away from home -- is something aquamorph likes to be. Efforts are being put into setting up a new building environment to generate new versions. So stay tuned!</p>


<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>September the 5th 2006 [<a href="http://www.livecd.org/">Morphix Commit Day 2006</a>] saw the light of <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/morphix/aquamorph_0.4.iso?download">aquamorph v0.4 final</a>!</p>
<p><del>Download the 0.4 Release Candidate! [v0.4rc1, released 2006-09-03] from this not too fast server</del> [<em>update</em>: the final is there, yay!]. This build doesn't have Sun's Java, as it's still non-Free and takes in a lot of space. If there's demand for it, I'll put it in anyway. There *are* fonts and audio/video codecs on board, so go ahead and enjoy. I'll test it on some real machines [thus far, only on emulators], and maybe write a manual, after which the final will appear here, and will be available for download from faster sites.</p>
<p>Download the really old version [v0.2, released 2004-07-28] from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71814">Morphix' SourceForge.net repository</a>, but I'd really recommend the 0.4 version ;)</p>
