<h2>Introducing</h2>

<!--
<p>Originally based on <a href="http://morphix.org">Morphix' Lightgui</a> and upgraded to the newest base availabe [<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/morphix/MorphixBase-0.4-0c.iso?download">base 0.4-0e</a> for version 0.2], aquamorph is a rather complete livecd. It features <a href="http://www.xfce.org">xfce4</a> and many tools I use in my daily life. I included my own Morphix cq. aquamorph background, and all plugins for the xfce4 panel I found in the Debian/sid and os-works.com repositories, plus the cpugraph one I compiled myself [please let me know if you're missing one from <a href="http://xfce-goodies.berlios.de">xfce-goodies.berlios.de</a>]. It's up-to-date [apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade is soooo wonderfull] and includes more programs to be even more usefull ;). Well, it's more that I've made it rather slick and complete, so I could install it right on my own computers when I want to clean up / install :) or just want a working <a href="http://www.debian.org/">GNU/Linux</a> environment on a non-*nix pc. Besides that, I came to use it quite frequently for reparing broken installs of various OS'es with a livecd session too.</p>
<p>aquamorph aims to be a livecd with all programs an average computer user needs [like browser, email and <acronym title="Instant Messageing">IM</acronym> software, powerful enough office programs, multimedia software etc], and some development tools for the more powerful user, but staying light, easy to comprehend and attractive to the eye.</p>
<p>Take a look at the current <a href="/projects/aquamorph/README">README</a>, including changelog, todo list and stuff.</p>

<p><em>[Updated for the upcoming v0.3]</em> Originally based on <a href="http://morphix.org">Morphix' Lightgui</a>, aquamorph is a complete, up-to-date environment, in which the user can comfortably browse, program and generally just do her work, while not having to worry about configuring and installing things. It features programs like Mozilla's Firefox browser [with the Macromedia Flash plugin already installed] and Thunderbird e-mail client, X-Chat for IRC chatting, Gaim for Instant Messaging etc. It also packages some nice fonts, the Java 1.5 environment and video codecs.</p>

<p>Releases have been slow, but I'm currently setting up a way to make the process of creating a new mainmodule and therefore a new cd image [.iso] a lot easier. I'll be able to create a completely up-to-date image in just a few commands then, so it will be up to <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' hosting to set the pace in which I can upload new versions. I think I'll release once a month, but of course that depends on my free time and <a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a>' hosting</p>

<p>Of course it's nice to hear from users, whether they are happy, or have some things to add. <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?id=4">Please be welcome to the aquamorph forum</a>.</p>
