<h2>CPU Frequency Control</h2>
First remove this:
<pre>
apt-get remove powernowd
</pre>

<p>Then instal sysfsutils, cpufreqd, cpufrequtils:</p>

<pre>
apt-get install sysfsutils cpufreqd cpufrequtils
</pre>

<p>Now we'll load the modules:</p>
<pre>
modprobe speedstep-centrino
modprobe cpufreq_conservative
modprobe cpufreq_ondemand
modprobe cpufreq_powersave
modprobe cpufreq_stats
modprobe cpufreq_userspace
</pre>
<p>speedstep-centrino is the module for controlling centrino processors, the rest are frequency "governors". 
We'll test that everything went as expected:</p>
<pre>
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
</pre>
<p>You should see output similar to</p>
<pre>
powersave conservative ondemand performance userspace
</pre>
You can change the current scheme by something like
<pre>
echo powersave &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
</pre>
And view the current cpu frequency by
<pre>
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
</pre>

<p>Now we need to load them at boot time.
Add the following lines to the end of /etc/modules</p>
<pre>
speedstep-centrino
cpufreq_conservative
cpufreq_ondemand
cpufreq_powersave
cpufreq_stats
cpufreq_userspace
</pre>
<p>Add the following lines to /etc/sysfs.conf</p>
<pre>
devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor=userspace
</pre>
<p>Where userspace can be changed to another governor type (i.e. conservative, powersave, etc.). You can also add other configuration options that are specific to the governor selected.</p>

<p>Now you can add a cpu applet to your favourite panel [like CPUFreq plugin for the xfce4 panel, or the <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-change-cpu-frequency-scaling-in-ubuntu.html">cpu frequency changing applet in Gnome, as described in this Ubuntu howto</a>. This applet can also change governors]. The ondemand mode seems to work really decently for me. powersave is even more agressive in preserving power, which will result in a clocked down cpu the whole time.</p>
<!--Tip: Whenever I plug out of AC power and plug in again, I would find myself on "performance" governor, I would then change to powersave to change the cpu frequency.</p>-->
