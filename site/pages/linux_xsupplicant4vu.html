<p>As I study <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/">Computer Science on the Vrije Universiteit</a> in Amsterdam, I wanted to use my <a href="http://www.debian.org/">GNU/Linux</a> laptop with their wireless network. As they are using some neat encryption schemes, involving rotating wep keys, eap-ttls, pap and such, for which you need the Aegis client on windows [or the Intel Pro/wireless program as I use with my <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/">ipw2200 chip</a> on my Centrino based laptop]. I had to configure <a href="http://www.open1x.org/">xsupplicant</a> accordingly. You can find my configuration for <a href="http://www.open1x.org/">xsupplicant</a> 1.x on this page.</p>

<p>These settings will most likely work with other highly secured networks too, so I hope this page will help others too.</p>


<h2>Configure your laptop to work with the wireless network of the VU</h2>
<p>My /etc/xsupplicant/xsupplicant.conf [note that my wifi connection is on eth1. you may want to change that to wlan0 or something]:</p>
<pre>
network_list = default, VU-Campusnet

allow_interfaces = eth1
deny_interfaces = eth0, lo

logfile = /var/log/xsupplicant.log

VU-Campusnet
{
        type = wireless
        wireless_control = yes
        allow_types = eap-ttls
        identity = &lt;BEGIN_ID&gt;YOUR_VUNET_ID@vu.nl&lt;END_ID&gt;

        eap-ttls
        {
                root_cert = NONE
                phase2_type = pap
                pap
                {
                        username = &lt;BEGIN_UNAME&gt;YOUR_VUNET_ID@vu.nl&lt;END_UNAME&gt;

                        password = &lt;BEGIN_PASS&gt;YOUR_PASSWORD&lt;END_PASS&gt;
                }
        }
}
</pre>

<p><em>Note</em> that no dhclient's should be running and the wep key configured for the wireless interface should be all zero's before running the following script. [You can check this with iwconfig]</p>

<p>I got feedback that in xsupplicant 1.2 some things aren't supported anymore and the syntax has changed a bit. This should work:</p>

<pre>
network_list = default, VU-Campusnet

logfile = /var/log/xsupplicant.log

default
{
}

VU-Campusnet
{
        type = wireless
        wireless_control = yes
        allow_types = eap-ttls
        identity = YOUR_VUNET_ID@vu.nl

        eap-ttls
        {
                root_cert = NONE
                phase2_type = pap
                pap
                {
                        username = YOUR_VUNET_ID@vu.nl
                        password = YOUR_PASSWORD
                }
        }
}
</pre>

<p>My wifi_vu enable script [save as executable script and execute when you want to use the network]:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
iwconfig eth1 mode Managed
iwconfig eth1 enc open
iwconfig eth1 essid VU-Campusnet
ifconfig eth1 up

dhclient eth1
ntpdate ntp.cs.uu.nl
</pre>

<p>The last line is for synchronizing the clock through <acronym title="Network Time Protocol">NTP</acronym>, which I do per default, as it's such an easy way to keep them all in sync. You can remove it, or substitute an <acronym title="Network Time Protocol">NTP</acronym> server near you to make it work [better]</p>
