<p><em>Update at 2007-09-17:</em> You can nowadays just do an <code>apt-get install fglrx-driver fglrx-kernel-src</code>, then start from point 2 of the installing sequence.</p>

<p>This is a small howto to get the <a href="http://ati.com/">ATI</a> fglrx driver working on your <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> [sid] installation. As of 8.25.18 the driver finally supports Xorg 7.0</p>

<h2>The steps</h2>

<h3>Foreplay</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://support.ati.com/">ATI's support page and download the latest driver for you platform</a> [mind whether you are on 32bits or 64bits]</li>
	<li>The filename will be something like: ati-driver-installer-8.25.18-x86.run , where 8.25.18 is the driver version and x86 your platform</li>
	<li>Copy this file to a dir like /usr/src</li>
	<li>Run it: sh ati-driver-installer-8.25.18-x86.run</li>
	<li>It'll ask you about what you want it to do; choose "create packages for my platform"</li>
	<li>Choose to create Debian packages [of course]</li>
	<li>Agree with the license</li>
	<li>Enter some installation path [/ is fine, enter /tmp/blah if you don't need ATI's install log and license file]</li>
	<li>Check Debian packages</li>
	<li>Choose the Debian flavour you're on</li>
	<li>When it's finished, it'll have generated various .deb's</li>
	<li>If you haven't got module-assistant installed, do that now: apt-get install module-assistant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installing</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Install fglrx-driver_xxx.deb and fglrx-kernel-src_xxx.deb</li>
	<li>m-a update</li>
	<li>m-a prepare</li>
	<li>m-a</li>
	<li>SELECT and check fglrx-kernel</li>
	<li>Follow the steps in the screen</li>
	<li>Be sure to install the driver when asked</li>
	<li>Done!</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, you're done installing the driver. Try modprobe fglrx now. If it complains about version magic and an Invalid module format, purge all fglrx-* packages from your system [apt-get --purge remove fglrx-* and try again]. Edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the Driver entry in the Device section to "fglrx". Restart X.</p>

<p>Now you can check whether it works: run glxinfo and check whether direct rendering is enabled, and whether ATI is doing that for you [glxinfo | grep direct]. fglrxinfo should give you some more info. Of course, you can test with glxgears too, but as this isn't a benchmark -- which you should be aware of -- but rather a testing tool, you have to start it with -printfps.</p>
