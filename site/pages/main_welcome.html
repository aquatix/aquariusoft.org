<p>AquariuSoft.org hosts the applications and other projects by AquariuSoft.</p>

<p>Take a look at a work in progress: <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">the overload RSS feedreader</a>. Log in for a demonstration with demo/demo and be sure to check <a href="page/html/overload/">the overload project page</a> now and then for updates.</p>

<p>Currently the most active projects are my <a href="page/html/">web projects</a>. Not that <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">the aquamorph livecd</a> is forgotten [at 2005-11-20, an alpha version is being tested], and neither are the other projects. I just have to spread my sparse free time among the things that interest me most at a given time and I don't want to spread it thin.</p>

<p>The old <a href="page/windows/">Windows programs</a> aren't under active development anymore; detailed product pages are still missing, but there's <a href="page/windows/">an overview page</a>, from which the [rather old] versions can be downloaded and a short description can be read. Mind that contact information mentioned in the programs is outdated.</p>

<!--
<p><em>N.B.:</em> The windows programs haven't been updated in quite a while and are using old e-mail addresses and the url of the old site. The correct e-mail address for questions about Windows programs of AquariuSoft is <i>windows</i> at <i>aquariusoft</i> dot <i>org</i>. The correct url is the url of the site you are visiting at this moment: <a href="http://aquariusoft.org/">http://aquariusoft.org/</a>. Updates will follow when I've got time to review the programs.</p>
-->

<p>One of the projects of AquariuSoft is <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a>, a linux live-cd based on <a href="http://morphix.org/">Morphix</a>, which on it's own is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>.</p>
