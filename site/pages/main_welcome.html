<h2>News</h2>

<p>Currently the most active projects are the <a href="page/html/">web projects</a>. However, <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">the aquamorph livecd</a> is still under active development to get a polished livecd for general use. Also the other projects aren't forgotten either. I just have to spread my sparse free time among the things that interest me most at a given time and I don't want to spread it thin.</p>

		<p>Take a look at a work in progress: <a href="https://overload.aquariusoft.org/">the overload RSS feedreader</a>. Log in for a demonstration with demo/demo and be sure to check <a href="page/html/overload/">the overload project page</a> now and then for updates. The overload project is currently being rewritten in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">the Django framework</a>, which allows for a cleaner codebase and better maintainability, let alone an easier way to add new ways of accessing and storing your information.</p>

<h3>The Qik site framework</h3>
<p>One of the projects of AquariuSoft is <a href="page/html/qik/">Qik</a>, a <a href="http://www.php.org/">PHP</a> based framework for quickly setting up a site, even multilingual if you want. No need to use databases, only PHP has to be installed. You don't even have to know anything about PHP programming to set up a site with it!</p>

<h3>windows programs</h3>
<p>The old <a href="page/windows/">Windows programs</a> aren't under active development anymore; detailed product pages are still missing, but there's <a href="page/windows/">an overview page</a>, from which the [rather old] versions can be downloaded and a short description can be read. Mind that contact information mentioned in the programs is outdated.</p>
