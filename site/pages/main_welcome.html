<h2>Welcome to aquariusoft.org</h2>
<p>This site is the base for all projects by AquariuSoft, also known as Michiel Scholten. AquariuSoft is specialised in web development, system and network administration (Linux) and application development.</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<p>Currently the most active projects are the <a href="page/html/">web projects</a>. However, <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">the aquamorph livecd</a> is still under active development to get a polished livecd for general use. Also the other projects aren't forgotten either. I just have to spread my sparse free time among the things that interest me most at a given time and I don't want to spread it thin.</p>
<p>Also, work is being done at the site of <a href="http://apotheekwaterrijck.nl/">Apotheek Waterrijck</a>, which will soon get an update.</p>

<h3>The Qik site framework</h3>
<p>One of the projects of AquariuSoft is <a href="page/html/qik/">Qik</a>, a <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> based framework for quickly setting up a site, even multilingual if you want. No need to use databases, only PHP has to be installed. You don't even have to know anything about PHP programming to set up a site with it!</p>
