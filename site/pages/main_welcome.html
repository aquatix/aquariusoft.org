<h2>News</h2>

<p>Currently the most active projects are my <a href="page/html/">web projects</a>. However, <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">the aquamorph livecd</a> has seen a release recently too, and is under active development to get a polished livecd for general use. Also the other projects aren't forgotten either. I just have to spread my sparse free time among the things that interest me most at a given time and I don't want to spread it thin.</p>

The overload project is currently being rewritten in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">the Django framework</a>, which allows for a cleaner codebase and better maintainability, let alone an easier way to add new ways of accessing and storing your information.</p>

<h3>aquamorph</h3>
<p>One of the projects of AquariuSoft is <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">aquamorph</a>, a linux live-cd based on <a href="http://morphix.org/">Morphix</a>, which on it's own is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

<h3>windows programs</h3>
<p>The old <a href="page/windows/">Windows programs</a> aren't under active development anymore; detailed product pages are still missing, but there's <a href="page/windows/">an overview page</a>, from which the [rather old] versions can be downloaded and a short description can be read. Mind that contact information mentioned in the programs is outdated.</p>
