<h2>News</h2>
<p>Currently the most active projects are the <a href="page/html/">web projects</a>, <a href="page/python/">Python modules</a>, and <a href="page/django/">Python/Django stuff</a>. <a href="page/linux/aquamorph/">The aquamorph livecd</a> is not under development anymore and some other projects have been deprecated too. Those are prefixed with âŒš, to denote them being outdated.</p>

<p>The other projects aren't forgotten though. I just have to spread my sparse free time among the things that interest me most at a given time and I don't want to spread it thin.</p>

		<h3>aquamorph</h3>

<h3>The Qik and paragoo site frameworks/generators</h3>
<p>One of the projects of AquariuSoft has been actively maintaining the last few years was <a href="page/html/qik/">Qik</a>, a <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> based framework for quickly setting up a site, even multilingual if you want. No need to use databases, only PHP has to be installed. You don't even have to know anything about PHP programming to set up a site with it!</p>

<p>However, it has been largely superceded by <a href="page/html/paragoo/">paragoo</a>, a static site generator compatible with a big part of Qik's configuration, but built in Python and compiling everything to static html files.</p>
